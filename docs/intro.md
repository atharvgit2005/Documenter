## The NYX Studios Vision

The founding team demonstrated early success by progressing from concept to a functional MVP during the CONSTruct 2025 hackathon. Reaching the finale provided the founders with strong market validation, proving their ability to execute rapidly under pressure and adapt to live technical challenges.

Today, the founders are focused on a "speed-first" startup culture, moving toward a public launch on Product Hunt and establishing a scalable vision for an AI-powered content agency.
